#Hello!
I'm Tyler Nitzsche, a junior majoring in computer science and minoring in chinese. My primary focus is on machine learning so I wanted to take this course to help
with the data management side of that. My current experience in machine learning is where during my internship at ORNL I created a NLP based research assistant which 
could read research paper abstracts and make predictions if they were in a specified category within the Arxiv tags and also predict whether the user would be interested 
in the paper based on their past papers which they have marked as interested. Beyond my academic interests I tend to find interest in pretty much anything that might 
fall under the category of "Nerdy":
*video games,
*card games
*board games
*books
*shows
*movies
whatever, if it's nerdy I've probably at least heard of it.  My main programming languages are C++ and python
